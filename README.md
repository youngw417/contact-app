###### Contact Keeper is the contact management app which I coded on React framework with context API for state management, UI with Materialize-CSS for front-end. The back-end was coded on NodeJS, utilized with JsonWebToken for server-side authentication for protected routes, data on cloud based database, MongboDB Atlas. This is my personal project.
